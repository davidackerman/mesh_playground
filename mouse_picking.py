Perspective projection is quite simple in opengl.
f = 1.0 / tan(radians(fovy / 2.0))
px = x * f / aspect
py = y * f
pz = z * (far+near) / (near-far) + 2*far*near / (near-far)
wx = px / (-z)
wy = py / (-z)
wz = pz / (-z)
The resulting values are between -1 and 1.
To learn more about perspective projection, martin baker's
site is quite good for that.

This means unprojection is equally simple. How to get x and y
for z = -1 ?

    Picks the vertex that has the shortest distance
    to the ray.
    
    There are some things with dot product
    that allow you to determine the distance
    from a ray if you need to know.
    You have ray's direction and a vertex. Ray starts
    from origo (0, 0, 0). To get the distance, you can
    project the vector to the ray. The projected point
    is the nearest point at vertex picked from the ray.
    Take their difference and calculate it's length.
    here's some math for you. 
    Projection of A to the B: B * (A.dot(B) / B.dot(B))
    When B is normalized, you can just do: B.dot(B)
    because x*x+y*y+z*z of a normalized vector is 1.

    Intuition on dot product: If it is zero, the angle
    between vectors is 90 degrees. If it is positive,
    then that's less than 90 degrees. If negative,
    then more than 90 degrees.
